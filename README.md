# TOP Etch-a-Sketch Project

This project is for The Odin Project's (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) "Etch-a-Sketch" project, which tests my ability to utilize DOM manipulation and flexbox.

In creating this, I was able to learn how to iteratively create DOM elements with loops, and how to use the 'mouseover' event listener.

## Reflection

Honestly, this project was pretty easy for me to complete. I was able to do all but the extra credit in less than half an hour. I spent some time fiddling with the 2nd extra credit (creating the incrementing opacity) because I wanted to see if I could make the opacity not apply to the borders. I succeeded, but not without some messy code and errors, so I decided not to commit that version and allow the borders of each square to be affected by the opacity changes. If anyone has a better way of doing this, let me know!
